# Blog
I've been wanting to merge all of my blog content onto my own platform. Blogger isn't bad, but I want to be able to hack it as I see fit.

# Goals
* Edit content in HAML, in Textmate
* Store content in valid XHTML
* Keep track of versions
* Use MongoDB for storage
* Play with all the new hot auth stuff
